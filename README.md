# Parking-lot-occupancy
This verilog code is going to construct a circuit that counts the number of cars
in a parking structure using FSM methodology. The circuit can detect if the
car is entering the parking structure or leaving then the counter should count
up or down accordingly.
The Pdf file is a report that explains the project. It also shows figures and screenshots for the for the FSM and the testing of the algorithm.
